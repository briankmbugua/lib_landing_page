            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>This project was inspired by my love of books and my desire to create a system that would make it easier
                for people to manage their library collections. I started working on this project in January 2023, and I
                am currently working on adding new features and improving the user experience.</p>
            <p>This project was created as a portfolio project for Holberton School. I am a software engineer student at
                Holberton School, and I am passionate about building software that makes a difference in the world.</p>
